"""What has this establishment actually bought — asked once, answered for the whole console.

THE DEFECT THIS CLOSES. Every screen that shows a paid surface had to decide for itself whether the
shop owned it, and none of them could: the console renders a lock from a CAPABILITY, which is about
the person's role. An owner holds `campaigns.manage` on every plan, so the lock never appeared for
the one person who would have paid to remove it. The only screen that knew better was «محلّي», and
only because the insights dashboard happened to return `entitlements` alongside its numbers — one
key, folded into an unrelated payload, for one screen.

ONE CALL, NOT ONE PER SCREEN. Five keys asked five times from five screens is five round trips to
billing on every navigation, and five different answers during a deploy. Asked here, together, the
console holds one list and every lock in the product is drawn from it.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
THIS IS A DISPLAY, AND IT ENFORCES NOTHING

Not a softness — a boundary. The gates are in the services that own the acts (campaigns' create and
tick, loyalty's earn and adjust, insights' dashboard), they are asked at the act, and they fail
closed. If this answer were tampered with, the buttons it draws would still be refused by the
service behind them.

WHICH IS WHY IT DOES NOT FAIL CLOSED. A billing outage here would paint «لم تشترِ» across apps the
shop pays for every month — the worst sentence in the product to show a paying customer, and it
would be shown to ALL of them at once. Instead the failure is reported as itself: `checked: false`,
no ownership claimed either way, and a screen that says «تعذّر التحقق» and offers to retry.

# `feature.whatsapp` (the AI assistant's auto-reply/auto-booking over WhatsApp — NOT the ordinary

# already gated, live, at the one act that matters (whatsapp-assistant's own core/licence.py talks
# to billing directly — this file is not in that call path at all, exactly like every other key
# below is checked at its own act and not through this catalogue). A row here is what makes an app
# BROWSABLE: it draws its lock on a console screen and appears in `/apps`'s list. Its price has not
# been agreed, so — same as «المؤسسات» stays out of the ordinary plan listing until it is one a shop
# can actually choose — it stays out of this tuple until it is one they can actually buy. Add the
# row the day it is priced; nothing about the gate above needs to change when that happens.

# `feature.rating` (the post-visit rating app, WhatsApp Flow — stars + free text) IS THE SAME CASE
# AS `feature.bookings` WAS: it has a plan row now (`listed: false` in plans.json, `SOLD_UNBUILT`
# in ci/check_entitlements.py), but nothing checks the key yet and no shop can actually buy it —
# `listed: false` keeps it off `Plans.tsx`'s store grid regardless. Add the row here the same day
# the plan flips to `listed: true` — not before, or the console draws a lock on an app nobody can
